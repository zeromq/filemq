DESCRIPTION
-----------

The fmq_patch class works with one patch, which really just says "create
this file" or "delete this file" (referring to a fmq_file item each time).


EXAMPLE
-------
.From fmq_patch_test method
----
    fmq_file_t *file = fmq_file_new (".", "bilbo");
    fmq_patch_t *patch = fmq_patch_new (".", file, patch_create, "/");
    fmq_file_destroy (&file);
    
    file = fmq_patch_file (patch);
    assert (streq (fmq_file_name (file, "."), "bilbo"));
    assert (streq (fmq_patch_virtual (patch), "/bilbo"));
    fmq_patch_destroy (&patch);
