    track - track one directory with another
    
    Uses FILEMQ API to track one directory (e.g. MP3 player mount) with
    another (e.g. ~/Music). As you add and remove files in the main directory
    these are automatically created and removed in the tracked directory.
    
    Syntax: filemq original-directory tracking-directory
