    Names of states, events, and actions are case insensitive.
    By convention however we use uppercase for protocol events.

    <state name = "start" inherit = "defaults">
        The server will remain in this state when a client connects
        waiting for the client to initiate a conversation.
        <event name = "OHAI" next = "ready">
            The server receives the initiation of the converstation
            and responds if everything is OK.
            <action name = "send" message = "OHAI OK" />

    <state name = "ready" inherit = "defaults">
        The server now has a connected client we at this point need
        at least one subscrition and NOM credit before any files
        get dispatched.

            The server receives a subscription request from the
            connected client and therefore stores that subscription
            and responds if things are OK. This event does not move
            the server to a new state.
